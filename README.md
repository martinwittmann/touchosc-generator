# TouchOsc Generator

A generator for [TouchOsc](https://hexler.net/products/touchosc) files which greatly reduces repetive tasks and adds several helpful features not available in the original [TouchOsc Editor](https://hexler.net/products/touchosc#downloads).

TouchOsc Generator does not have a UI, but a script generating .touchosc files based on input files (json) describing the TouchOsc interface you want to build.




## Installation + Dependencies
To run TouchOsc Generator you need python3 and the jinja2 package.

```pip install jinja2```
